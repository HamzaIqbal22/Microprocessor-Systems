# COE538 - Microprocessor Systems

This course introduces students to small microprocessor-based systems, with an emphasis on
embedded system hardware and software design. Topics will include microprocessor architecture
and structure, with an overview of 8- 16- and 32-bit systems, assembly language programming
and the use of high-level languages. Basic input/output including parallel communications with and
without handshaking and serial protocols. Hardware and software timing. Using interrupts and
exceptions. Overview of single-chip microprocessors and controllers with an emphasis on the
Freescale HCS12. The internal structure and design of peripheral devices. Memory system design
and analysis. The use and structure of development tools such as (cross) assemblers or
compilers, monitor programs, simulators, emulators, etc.

Labs are conducted using a Motorola HCS12-based microprocessor board and computer-aided
design tools from Freescale, specifically "Special Edition: CodeWarrior for HCS12(X)
Microcontrollers (Classic).

The project is to program the eebot mobile robot with a navigation system that can find its way through a maze, reverse, and back its way out again. A possible variation on this is that the robot first learns the maze. Then it is started again at the beginning and should navigate the maze without errors.
